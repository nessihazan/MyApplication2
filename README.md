# MyApplication2
hi in this project I'll describe some of the Android SDK's data presentation tools, including the older list view, and its successor, recycler view. Using both of these components, I'll show you how to customize your data display, and handle common events. Then I'll move to data persistence. I'll show how to work with shared preferences, key value pairs that are stored in XML files and are managed automatically by the SDK.

Then I'll describe how to create your own files in internal and external persistent storage, and how to create and read JSON formatted data files, with the GSON library from Google. And finally, I'll show you how to create and manage an SQLite database, for working with more complex relational data.
